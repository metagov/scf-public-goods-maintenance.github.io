## Project Description

The Flutter Stellar SDK is a Dart library for building Stellar applications on iOS, Android, and web
using Flutter. It provides transaction building, account management, Horizon API access, Soroban RPC
support, high-level Soroban smart contract support, and implements 18 Stellar Ecosystem Proposals
(SEPs). The SDK is listed on the official Stellar developer documentation and is used by wallets and
applications including Beans App, Stack Wallet, Defindex, Meru, and others.

## Team & Experience

My name is Christian (GitHub: christian-rogobete, Discord: soneso, LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogobete/) and I am the main developer and maintainer of the Flutter
Stellar SDK. I have a master's degree in computer science and a master's degree in logistics and have
been working in the IT field since the mid-1990s as a developer, software architect, project manager,
and in other roles.

I began contributing to the Stellar network in 2017, specializing primarily in the development and
maintenance of Stellar SDKs. I developed the iOS Stellar SDK (which won the Stellar Build Challenge
in 2018), the Flutter Stellar SDK, the PHP Stellar SDK, and the Kotlin Multiplatform Stellar SDK.

I currently work full-time on my Stellar SDK projects.

Previous SCF participation: Multiple SCF Build Awards (Flutter Wallet SDK, Swift Wallet SDK, KMP
Stellar SDK, and others), SCF Public Goods Award since Q3 2025 (Batch 1) for iOS, Flutter, and PHP
SDKs. Member of the SCF Public Goods Maintenance working group.

## Retroactive Impact

In Q1 2026, the Flutter SDK shipped 7 releases (2.2.2 through 3.0.5), including the major release
3.0.0 which added full Flutter web platform support with a migration guide. The SDK is used by
wallets and applications including Beans App, Stack Wallet, Defindex, Meru and others. Stats (as of
April 10, 2026): 84 stars, 36 forks, 107 releases, pub.dev 14,345 downloads (52 weeks), 86 dependent
GitHub repos + 5 dependent packages, 0 open issues at end of quarter. Median time to close: 5.6h,
100% response rate.

Unit test coverage was extended and tracking was set up, currently at 88.98%, with a new CI pipeline
and Codecov integration (80% project, 70% patch thresholds). Bugs found during web testing and test
development were fixed. Protocol 25 support was added.

SEP-53 message signing was implemented, cross-SDK compatible with the Java, Python, iOS, and PHP
SDKs. A new XDR code generator replaces hand-written types with machine-generated code from Stellar's
canonical .x files, adding new types and round-trip tests. A daily upstream XDR change detection
workflow auto-creates issues when the spec changes. The SEP-11 TxRep implementation was rewritten to
delegate to code-generated methods.

An AI coding agent skill was published for AI-assisted development tools. The SDK documentation was
fully rewritten with tested code examples.

SBOM submission to PG Atlas was added and runs on every push. A new daily statistics collection has
been implemented and runs via https://github.com/Soneso/soneso-sdk-stats (live dashboard:
https://soneso.github.io/soneso-sdk-stats/).

## Past Deliverables

### 1. Continuous Maintenance and Improvement Deliverable

Description from last quarter: Regular SDK updates addressing horizon, rpc, protocol updates (e.g.
p25), bug fixes, feature requests (e.g. full web support), code modernization, unit test coverage
improvement, and documentation enhancements to ensure long-term sustainability. This includes a new
documentation for AI Coding Agents, a so called "skill", providing token efficient documentation and
best practices when using the SDK. Furthermore it includes setting up a configuration for unit test
coverage tracking and adding to CI/CD pipeline.

collect daily statistics for the Flutter SDK. Data collected: GitHub clones (daily counts and unique
cloners), meta data (stars, forks, watchers), activity (52-week commit history and full release
list), issue/PR response times with closure stats, pub.dev downloads (30-day, 4/12/52-week counts),
and GitHub dependents (repos and packages). Metrics (as of April 10, 2026): 84 stars, 36 forks, 107
releases, 0 open issues, median first response 2.1h, median time to close 5.6h, 100% response rate,
pub.dev 14,345 downloads (52 weeks), 86 dependent repos + 5 dependent packages. Live dashboard:
https://soneso.github.io/soneso-sdk-stats/

### 2. SEP-53 Support

Description from last quarter: SEP-53 standardizes message signing functionality across Stellar
wallets, libraries, and services, preventing ecosystem fragmentation and ensuring interoperability.
SEP-53 support is also implemented in the Java and Python SDKs.

Proof of completion:

- Release 3.0.1: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/releases/tag/3.0.1
- PR #126: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/pull/126
- SEP-53 compatibility matrix:
  https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/blob/master/compatibility/sep/SEP-0053_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md
- Documentation:
  https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/blob/master/documentation/sep/sep-53.md

Adds signMessage() and verifyMessage() on KeyPair with Uint8List and String overloads. Unit tests
cover all spec test vectors (ASCII, Japanese, binary), encoding round-trips, failure cases, and edge
cases. Cross-SDK compatible with the Java, Python, iOS, and PHP SDKs.

### 3. XDR Classes Generator

Description from last quarter: Currently the SDK has approximatively 400 manually written XDR classes
used to encode and decode XDR objects. Extensions or updates in the XDR structure need to be
implemented manually at this time, which makes the SDK difficult to maintain. The new XDR class
generator will improve the maintainability and also add missing XDR classes so that they can
immediately be used as new features require them.

Proof of completion:

- Release 3.0.3: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/releases/tag/3.0.3
- PR #131: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/pull/131
- Generator: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/tree/master/tools/xdr-generator
- XDR definitions: https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/tree/master/xdr
- CI workflow:
  https://github.com/Soneso/stellar_flutter_sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/xdr-generator.yml

Ruby-based code generator reads Stellar's canonical .x XDR definition files (from
https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr). Replaces hand-written XDR type definitions with
auto-generated Dart code and adds new types not previously in the SDK. Round-trip encode/decode unit
tests cover all generated types. CI snapshot tests verify generated code stays in sync with XDR
definitions. High-level SDK APIs unchanged. Daily upstream XDR change detection workflow auto-creates
GitHub issues when the spec changes.

## Proposed Impact

Keep the SDK compatible with Horizon, Soroban RPC, and protocol updates including Protocol 26.
Maintain existing SEP implementations and update as needed. Fix bugs and respond to issues and
feature requests.

Add support for OpenZeppelin Smart Accounts (C-address wallets) on Soroban, enabling passkey-based
wallet authentication, multi-signer authorization, and policy-based access control. This follows the
SCF RFP for C-Address Tooling and matches the implementation already shipped in the KMP Stellar SDK
(v1.4.0). A TypeScript reference exists in kalepail/smart-account-kit.

Smart account support in Flutter will allow cross-platform developers to build Stellar wallets with
OpenZeppelin smart accounts using passkeys and biometric authentication across iOS, Android, and web.

## Proposed Deliverables

### 1. Continuous Maintenance and Improvement

Regular SDK updates addressing Horizon, Soroban RPC, and protocol updates (including Protocol 26),
bug fixes, feature requests, and documentation updates. Maintain existing SEP implementations and
update as needed. Keep compatibility matrices, CI pipelines, statistics dashboard, and SBOM workflow
up to date.

Proof: Release notes on GitHub, updated compatibility matrices, soneso-sdk-stats dashboard.

### 2. OpenZeppelin Smart Account Support

Implement support for the OpenZeppelin smart account contracts on Soroban, covering:

- Wallet lifecycle: create, deploy, and connect smart account wallets with WebAuthn passkey
  registration
- Context rules and policies: create, edit, and remove authorization rules with configurable signers
  and policies
- Token operations and contract calls with automatic auth entry signing
- Multi-signer authorization: passkey signers, delegated Stellar account signers, and Ed25519 key
  signers
- Fee sponsoring via relayer proxy for gasless transactions
- Credential discovery via indexer integration
- Platform support: WebAuthn via ASAuthorization (iOS), CredentialManager (Android), and
  navigator.credentials (web) with secure storage adapters
- Cross-platform demo application (iOS, Android, web)
- Documentation: API reference and onboarding guide

Proof: Release on GitHub, PR with implementation, demo app, documentation, test suite.

### Budget justification

The budget increase from $15,000 to $18,000 reflects the addition of OpenZeppelin Smart Account
support, which is a major new feature involving cross-platform WebAuthn integration (iOS, Android,
web), a demo application, documentation, and manual testing across platforms (passkeys require
physical device testing).
