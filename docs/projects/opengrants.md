# OpenGrants

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

_OpenGrants is open data infrastructure for Web3 grants that maintains the largest cross-ecosystem
funding data set, including all completed SCF rounds._

## Project Description

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->

Even though billions in Web3 grant capital have been distributed, many ecosystems still struggle to
measure performance and prevent waste. We’ve built OpenGrants as the best publicly-available data
source for Web3 grants to allow projects to learn from each other, create a more vibrant space for
builders, and promote ecosystem-wide growth.

We believe the development of standards and benchmarks, and promotion of data-driven decision-making,
is necessary to support the maturation and growth of Web3 grants and DAO resource allocation
mechanisms. Through OpenGrants, we seek to address problems with data collection, quality, and
analysis, community transparency and engagement, as well as the efficiency and interoperability of
grant systems. Ultimately, OpenGrants will help promote the continuous improvement of Web3 grant
programs and the evolution of the Stellar ecosystem.

We've worked with the Stellar ecosystem since before the inception of OpenGrants, collaborating on
the underlying infrastructure and data standard, DAOIP-5. We have previously received three public
goods awards from Stellar, taking the DAOIP-5 standard and transforming it into open data
infrastructure featuring a gateway API, ecosystem funding dashboard, and SCF grant reporting.

## Retroactive Impact

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->


Over the last three months, OpenGrants delivered on its maintenance mandate. We ensured the continued full integration and visualization of up-to-date SCF funding data with zero downtime, while broadening our datasets to enable richer comparative analysis across the Web3 grant landscape.

This generated the following impact for the Stellar ecosystem:

- OpenGrants infrastructure was used to bootstrap another ecosystem project, PG Atlas, providing the SCF project data that serves as the starting nodes for PG Atlas's dependency graph.
- OpenGrants maintained Stellar's 100% DAOIP-5 compliance rate throughout the period including SCF #43 data.
- OpenGrants expanded its ecosystem funding datasets, onboarding and integrating data from ENS. enabling greater comparative analytic capabilities.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->

## Past Deliverables

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->

1. **Ongoing maintenance and iteration of OpenGrants infrastructure — Completed / ongoing.** Integrated new funding data from SCF #43, keeping Stellar in full DAOIP-5 compliance; built real-time integration to SCF funding data; and updated the data pipeline to include an Airtable integration.

1. **Support for the PG Atlas team — Completed / ongoing.** Supplied SCF project data as dependency-graph seed nodes and scoped a roadmap toward fully automated data ingestion based on PG Atlas team feedback.

## Proposed Impact

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->

For the next three months, OpenGrants will remain the reliable, up-to-date source of structured Stellar funding data while making targeted improvements to legibility, automation, and downstream usability. Alongside zero-downtime hosting and continued 100% DAOIP-5 compliance, Q3 focuses on reducing manual overhead in data ingestion, improving how Stellar-specific funding data is surfaced, and exposing OpenGrants data programmatically so agents and downstream tools can consume it directly.

1. **Data-driven SCF governance.** Recurring, per-round Intelligence Reports give delegates and the community consistent funding and milestone analytics at decision time, building directly on the SCF 41 report that informed community voting.

2. **Lower-friction, more reliable data infrastructure.** Polishing the SCF ingestion pipeline toward full automation reduces manual steps and the risk of data gaps, keeping Stellar funding data accurate and current using AI agents for automation.

3. **Programmatic access for downstream tooling.** An MCP server exposes the OpenGrants dataset so agents, researchers, and dependent projects (including PG Atlas) can query funding data directly, strengthening OpenGrants as shared ecosystem infrastructure.

4. **Improved legibility of Stellar funding data.** A dedicated Stellar project view and an About page make OpenGrants easier to understand and navigate for community members, delegates, and reviewers, directly supporting clearer user signal during evaluation.

5. **Ongoing hosting, maintenance, and continued support for dependent projects.** Ongoing operational support for PG Atlas and any new dependencies that build on OpenGrants data.

## Proposed Deliverables

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->

1. **SCF Intelligence Report.** OpenGrants generates and publishes a funding Intelligence Report to the SCF community for the next round (SCF #45), which includes the following data: funding distribution, category breakdowns, milestone and tranche completion trends, and comparison against prior rounds. Builds on the SCF #41 Intelligence Report that delegates used during community voting, turning a one-off contribution into a repeatable governance input.

   - _Ecosystem value: consistent, data-driven context for delegates and the community during the decision-making and voting process of every SCF round._

2. **Data integration automation.** Polish and harden the ingestion pipeline toward fully automated data ingestion, reducing manual steps (per PG Atlas team feedback). 

    - *Ecosystem value: more reliable, always-current Stellar funding data with less operational overhead. Setting this base infra enables us to build towards more intelligent data points.*

3. **MCP server for OpenGrants.** Ship an MCP server exposing the OpenGrants dataset so agents and downstream tools can query funding data directly. 

    - *Ecosystem value: makes OpenGrants data programmatically consumable by agents, researchers, and dependent projects.*

4. **More legible data with greater signal**  

    4.a. **Stellar project view.** A dedicated, improved view surfacing SCF funded project's funding data for easier navigation. 
For example: View OpenGrants and its funding history by SCF.
    - _Ecosystem value: clearer, SCF-specific legibility for community members and reviewers._

    4.b. **About page for OpenGrants.** An About page documenting what OpenGrants is, its data sources, and how to use the infrastructure.
    - _Ecosystem value: lowers the barrier to understanding and adopting OpenGrants._

5. **Ongoing hosting and maintenance.** Zero-downtime operation of OpenGrants infrastructure and continuous SCF funding data updates, maintaining Stellar's 100% DAOIP-5 compliance rate. 

    *Ecosystem value: uninterrupted community access to structured funding data that eliminates data loss and fragmentation.*

6. **PG Atlas and dependency support.** Continued operational support for the PG Atlas team and any other new dependencies. 
_Ecosystem value: sustains downstream projects building on OpenGrants data._
