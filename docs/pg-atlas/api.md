# API Layer

## Overview

The API layer exposes PG Atlas data and computed metrics to the public dashboard, Tansu voting
context, community tools, and third-party integrations. It is implemented with FastAPI, following
RESTful principles for predictability and ease of consumption.

**Key principles**:

- Read-only for v0 (no writes via public API — ingestion handled internally via webhooks/actions).
- No GraphQL — prevents expensive arbitrary queries that could overload single-machine backend.
- Resource-oriented endpoints with standard HTTP methods (primarily GET).
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting where appropriate.
- Rate limiting and caching to protect resources.
- Comprehensive OpenAPI specification auto-generated for language-agnostic access.

**Goals**:

- Enable transparent community verification of metrics.
- Provide off-chain context for Tansu rounds without on-chain dependency.
- Mitigate Python lock-in via OpenAPI docs and multi-language examples (TypeScript, Rust, Go).
- Support dashboard needs plus broader ecosystem tooling (e.g., custom scorecards, dependency
  alerts).

## Base URL & Formats

- Base: `/api/v1` (versioned for future stability).
- Response format: JSON (default); optional CSV for table structures and raw artifacts via Accept
  header.
- Error responses: Standard HTTP codes with JSON body `{ "detail": "message" }`, following FastAPI +
  Pydantic defaults.

## Authentication & Authorization (v0)

- Public read-only — no auth required.
- Future: API keys for higher rate limits or write access (admin ingestion).

## Rate Limiting

- Global: 100 requests/minute per IP (configurable).
- Burst protection via token bucket.
- Headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`.

## Core Endpoints (v0)

### Health & Metadata

- `GET /health` — Returns `{ "status": "ok", "last_computed": timestamp }`.
- `GET /metadata` — Ecosystem summary: total nodes/edges, active count, last full recompute.

### Ecosystem Projects

- `GET /projects` — List projects with pagination and filters.
  - Query params: `type=pg_root`, `activity_status=live`, `search=keyword`, `limit=50`, `offset=0`.
  - Response: Paginated list with basic fields (canonical_id, display_name, type, activity_status,
    git_org_url, criticality_score, pony_factor, adoption_score).

- `GET /projects/{canonical_id}` — Detailed project view.
  - Includes: metadata, activity_status, aggregated metrics (criticality_score, pony_factor,
    adoption_score), list of child repos with their metrics.

- `GET /projects/{canonical_id}/repos` — List all repos belonging to this project.
  - Response: Array of repo objects with per-repo metrics and metadata.

### Repos

- `GET /repos` — List repos with pagination and filters.
  - Query params: `project_id=...`, `activity_status=live`, `search=keyword`, `limit=50`, `offset=0`.
  - Response: Paginated list with basic fields (canonical_id, display_name, project_id,
    activity_status, latest_version, latest_commit_date, criticality_score, pony_factor,
    adoption_downloads, adoption_stars).

- `GET /repos/{canonical_id}` — Detailed repo view.
  - Includes: metadata, adoption signals, direct dependents and dependencies, parent project
    reference.

### Dependencies

- `GET /repos/{canonical_id}/dependents` — Direct (active) dependents of this repo.
  - Query: `active=true`, `within_ecosystem=true`.

- `GET /repos/{canonical_id}/dependencies` — Direct/upstream dependencies of this repo.
  - Query: `active=true`, `within_ecosystem=true`.

- `GET /repos/{canonical_id}/blast-radius` — Transitive within-ecosystem dependents. Only available
  for repos belonging to `type=pg_root` projects, 404 otherwise.

- `GET /projects/{canonical_id}/dependents` — Project-level dependents (derived from repo-level
  edges, collapsed to distinct dependent projects).

- `GET /projects/{canonical_id}/dependencies` — Project-level dependencies (derived from repo-level
  edges, collapsed to distinct dependency projects).

### Metrics & Scores

These are early thoughts. Needs to be revisited after fleshing out use cases.

- `GET /scores` — Leaderboard of PGs sorted by composite or individual metric.
  - Query: `sort=-criticality_score`, `min_criticality=5`, `level=project` (default) or `level=repo`.

- `GET /scores/{canonical_id}` — Full PG Score breakdown (components JSON).
  - Works for both project and repo canonical IDs.
  - Project-level: aggregated criticality, pony_factor, adoption_score.
  - Repo-level: direct criticality, pony_factor, adoption_downloads, adoption_stars, adoption_forks.

### Bulk Exports

- `GET /export/projects` — CSV/JSON dump of all projects with aggregated metrics (cached quarterly).
- `GET /export/repos` — CSV/JSON dump of all repos with per-repo metrics.
- `GET /export/graph` — Simplified graph JSON (within-ecosystem repo nodes + edges array, for offline
  analysis). Optionally `?level=project` for project-level collapsed graph.

## Caching & Performance

- Endpoint-level caching (Redis or in-memory for v0) for expensive reads (e.g., leaderboards).
- ETag/If-None-Match support for conditional requests.
- Background recompute does not block reads (serve last-known scores).

## OpenAPI & Client Generation

- Auto-documented at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`.
- Provide official Typescript SDK as an example of OpenAPI client generation.

## Open Questions

- Additional filters (e.g., by ecosystem, SCF project linkage)?
- Webhook for metric change notifications (post-v0)?
- Collect a list of use cases beyond the dashboard/Tansu.

<!-- FUTURE SELF: Add endpoint for pony factor raw stats once extended git parsing implemented. -->

<!-- INGESTION IMPACT: No public write endpoints in v0 — internal webhook separate from this
layer. -->
